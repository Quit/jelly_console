-- Adds one or multiple commands called `names' (or elements of `names') that point towards `callback'.
-- lua functions will most likely override same-named JS functions. It's possible to name your lua functions with
-- special characters, but whitespace is not allowed, neither are '@' at the beginning.
--
-- Note that `callback` is a function receiving the following parameters:
-- * cmdName: Name of the cmd, identical with what it was called (and one of the registered names)
-- * args: List of arguments. This can be either parsed (if called with "name") or the raw, space-splitted arguments (if called with "@name")
-- * arg_string: The raw string after the command as it was entered by the user. Useful for eval, naming and the like.
-- * response: The response object from the call handler in case you wish to manually resolve/reject the answer. Note that as of current, this has no observable effect on the console.
-- The return value of `callback` is returned to the console and displayed as JSON. Errors are caught by jelly_console and displayed accordingly.
-- `callback` will be put into a different environment which allows it access to console-exclusive functions and variables:
-- * SELECTED: last selected entity using the 'select' command
